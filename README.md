_How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?_

In this project, I applied clean coding practices such as proper variable naming, modular functions, and detailed in-line comments to make the code maintainable and adaptable. The CRUD Python module was structured using object-oriented programming principles, allowing easy reuse of database-related functionalities. By separating the concerns of the data layer (MongoDB CRUD) from the presentation layer (Dash), the system is more modular and easier to extend. These techniques also ensure that future projects can reuse these components for various database operations.

_How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?_

My approach began with a thorough understanding of the requirements, breaking them down into manageable tasks such as setting up the MongoDB connection, implementing CRUD operations, and building the dashboard UI. For instance, when working with the dashboard, I ensured the model-view-controller (MVC) structure was followed, which allowed clear separation between the database logic and the user interface. This project challenged me to think critically about client needs and how to best represent data visually and interactively. In the future, I would employ the same structured approach, using MVC design patterns and modular coding practices to meet client requirements for database-driven applications.

_What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?_

Computer scientists develop software solutions that solve real-world problems, and this project is an example of how software can enhance an organization's operations. For Grazioso Salvare, the dashboard allows them to efficiently analyze data, filter based on specific criteria, and visualize the location of animals, helping them streamline their process of identifying dogs for search-and-rescue training. The dashboardâ€™s ease of use and the ability to interact with large datasets empowers the organization to make data-driven decisions, which in turn improves their efficiency and effectiveness.
